## About Me <br/>

Hi, I'm Wes(He/Him), I'm a Cloud Engineer based around DC. I like clouds- I mostly work in AWS and GCP. I like tools that make clouds better, faster, stronger- Terraform, Chef, Jenkins. I like coding- mostly in python and ruby, but also some JS. I'm good enough to break things, and sometimes to fix them. 

I work as a consultant, and I teach/train engineers in cloud technologies. Some of that is stuff that I need a place to keep, so I decided I'd give bloging a try. So, I'm replacing my old Web Development portfolio with a more traditional blog because it aligns more with the kind of work I'm doing now- I can' really post a demo of a terraform IAM framework, but I can write about it. Also, things I put together for classes- labs, demos, projects etc, can all find a home here.

#### A Note About Privacy
I'm experimenting with Google Analytics to measure traffic to this site. Mostly, I just want to see if anyone other than my Mom visits this site (Hi Mom!). Right now, all the data collected is the default that Google collects. As I get more comfortable with using the service, I may make changes- which would be posted before implementation.
