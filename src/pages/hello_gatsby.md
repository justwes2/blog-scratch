#### Checking in on Web Dev

I came to cloud computing via web development, and its a skill set that I greatly admire/covet. I appreciate the ability to take some code, throw it out there, and have something that anyone with a computer or phone can see and use. I try to keep up with the comings and goings of web dev world, but often it falls off the table between CSPs, IaC frameworks, pipeline tools, and everything else that I _need_ to keep up with.  But when I realized that I didn't want all my markdowns to languish in my [Github](github.com/justwes2), the needs of the task aligned with the backlogged learning. Here's what I found coming back to web dev.

##### JAM Stack

When I wrote my first portfolio, I used a simple React frontend, and just didn't attach a backend. It worked well to hold the dozen or so pieces of data I needed it to have, and it was simple to host- first through github pages, then through surge.sh, and finally, in as S3 bucket. As I started hearing about JAM stack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) as the next cool thing in web dev, it caught my eye, since attaching an api call to a static frontend to dynamically populate data is a common serverless framework that I could support with a mix of cloud services that I work with regularly. I did some reading on a few options, and settled on Gatsby as a first stop. It's Remark Transformer supports markdown articles without much configuration, and most of my other needs seemed either supported via plugin, or doable with custom components. 

##### Is this really JavaScript?

Working in React and JSX, I definitely found the medium moved passed vanilla JavaScript, but Gatsby is so specialized in purpose and so extensible with its plugins, that its moved more to the realm of a domain specific language- a la Chef. This could be that I've been out of the JS game and this is just where that world is, but the Codewars JS Kata I would attempt periodically didn't really have much overlap with the kinds of problems I was dealing with in Gastby. But really, most of the problems I had weren't with code, so JavaScipt was an effective tool to express my intention in a machine-readable way, which is really all one could ask. 

The biggest hurdles I faced were error messages. I had one error that I encountered a few times in the initial build, and I had to
