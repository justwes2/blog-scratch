### Canary in the Coal Mine

Something a little different this month. My project, Canary in the Coal Mine, went live on A Cloud Guru- you can check it out [here](https://acloud.guru/series/acg-projects/view/303). This was a really awesome experience for me, given that I started my career in Cloud Engineering using A Cloud Guru to pass my AWS Associate Certs.
